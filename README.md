Victor Feitosa Personal Portfolio Website
====

## Intro
  This project contains all the components andata of my personal website. It is made using React and GatsbyJS, hosted with Github and data-driven by GraphQL. Feel free to browse through components and styles to check how's everything done!

## The code
  This project was made completely in GatsbyJS, with React, GraphQL and AnimeJS to handle all thigns in the front-end. Styles are done using SASS with the SCSS syntax. BEM is used as a naming methodology for the style code and JS is going with the ES6 and over syntax and semantics style.

## The design
  Design for the site was made using AdobeXD and the ColorSpace site (https://mycolor.space/) to get some nice colors for the theme. The design source files are present inside the project folder structure.

## License
  MIT, but please be reasonable.

## Misc
  That's pretty much it! Have fun and offer advice as much as you want!
