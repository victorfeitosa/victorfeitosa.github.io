      Currently, I work as a full time web developer, with focus in Front End and UI/UX design, still doing some backend work here and there, but mostly 
      desining pages, apps and systems from the ground up with a great team of developers at Intrapoint. We power one of Norways bigest Oil companies and 
      manage a huge system with a great range of modules for crisis management and subsystems such as ERPs and CRMs. We also do some contract work for 
      companies looking for great solutions with a full featured backend.
